# CanvasPluginExample
Example Canvas control plugin project

This project shows how to create a custom control assembly to use with CygNet Canvas.

Notes:
-  Reconfigure references to use proper file location
-  Configured the output path to be the CygNet\Bin directory or move the resultant binary to that location
